# Nord_Lights_Rev
Northern lights documentary site/experience - revision to original Fewd Nord Design final

(I hope this shows up, it appears on my Git app here, but not sure online.

Rather rough, most of the page layout elements are generally in place, but having difficulty w/ finessing and correcting details in CSS. There's also some bug that's showing on top of all pages, that I can't figure out through the console. Once I can correct elements on the pages, I'd like to add more content/design.

Also, I got the title elements to float/move, however it's only in type blocks at the moment. Will need to convert these to SVG..? )

LMK your thoughts - thanks!
